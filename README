README: Screen Recorder

Description: The screen recorder ruby application captures a user's remote session into an mp4 video.
The application relies on guacamole, a HTML5 remote desktop gateway (http://guac-dev.org) for accessing 
the remote sessions (RDP or VNC).

screen_recorder.rb: A ruby module that communicates with the guacd server and applies relevant operations on the buffered image as instructed by the server.

guacamole_parser.rb: A ruby module for parsing the instructions and data received from the guacd server.

image_processor.rb: A ruby module responsible for periodically writing the buffered images into a named pipe which is fed as input to the ffmpeg process.

test_recorder.rb: A test client that gets the relevant details from a config.yml file and records a video for about 60 seconds.

config.yml: YAML file with details about the remote server, guacd server, user credentials etc.

output.mp4: Sample mp4 video recorded using the application.
